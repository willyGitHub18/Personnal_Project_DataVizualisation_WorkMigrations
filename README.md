# Plotting Franceâ€™s Workers Migrations Using Python Data Manipulation Tools and D3.js

## Data Visualization project aiming at plotting a network 

The data used regarding *professional migrations* for the year 2016 in France has been found on the French national statistics bureau website. 

- To manipulate de data : **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Regex**
- To get geo coordinates : **GeoPy**.
- Plotting the network with **D3.js** and **Force-Directed Edge Bundling** (*source :* ***Holten et al.2009***)  

Visual inspiration from the work of [Darkhorse Analytics](https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/).
To understand the principles of Force-Directed Edge Bundling, *from data to viz* [article](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/edge_bundling.html) has been a great resource. Understanding the code behind the algorithm was much easier thanks to [Eric Fisher's work](https://gist.github.com/ericfischer/dafc36a3d212da4619dde2d392553c7a).
